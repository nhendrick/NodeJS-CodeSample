# NodeJS-CodeSample
Code Sample of Serverless Node JS API and Postman Automated Testing

This is a sample of code from a Node JS API I built at home as part of a serverless API project. I designed the API to be as standardized as possible in order to reduce time to build new functions. With this design I'm able to build out complex features within a couple hours with most time spent in the mongoose design.

This design was also implemented as part of the build out of automated testing for the API, I built a more generic postman object that would allow more flexibility with collection runner data files.
